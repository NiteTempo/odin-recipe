    <h2>Classic Meatball recipe</h2>
    <p>These meatballs can be eaten by themselves or with spaghetti, or however you like.</p>
    <p>Simple, yet delicious.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Seasoning and herbs</li>

        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Bread for breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions(How to make the meatball)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ingredients in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs.</li>
        <li> Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.</li>

    <br>
    <h3>How long to cook the meatballs</h3>
    <p>Cook the meatballs in batches, making sure you don't crowd the pan. It should take about 20 minutes, give or take, for the meatballs to be perfectly crisp and cooked through. Test their temperature first to be sure they're done (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the meatball should read at least 165 degrees F).</p>
